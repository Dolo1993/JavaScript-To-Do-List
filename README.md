 
# Overview

In this project, I have developed a web-based to-do list application to showcase my skills as a software engineer and further my learning in JavaScript. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript and its associated technologies by creating a functional to-do list that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. 

# Purpose 
The purpose of creating this software is to:

Gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript and its syntax.
Explore the principles of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Showcase my ability to build a user-friendly and interactive web application.
Learn about event handling and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
I have created a 4-5 minute demonstration video on YouTube, which not only showcases the software in action but also provides a walkthrough of the code. The focus of the video is to share the insights I gained regarding the language syntax and how I applied it in this project.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools and technologies:

Text Editor: I wrote the code using Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor.
Programming Languages: The main language used for this project is JavaScript. HTML and CSS were also employed for creating the web interface.
Libraries: I utilized basic JavaScript libraries for DOM manipulation.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to enhance and improve this to-do list application by:.

- Adding user authentication to allow multiple users to have their individual to-do lists.
- Implementing data persistence to store tasks across sessions.
- Improving the user interface and design for a more appealing user experience. 
- Enhancing task management features, such as priority levels and due dates. 
- Making the application responsive to different screen sizes for mobile accessibility.
